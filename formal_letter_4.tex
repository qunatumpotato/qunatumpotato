%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\opening{To whomever it may concern,}

With great pleasure, I write this letter for Chaganti Kamaraja Siddhartha to support his application to the Globalink Research Internship. Siddhartha is passionately involved in his studies and intensely driven toward research. He possesses necessary scientific and reasoning capabilities and is a pretty pleasant student. He is one of the hardworking students to have worked under my guidance. \\ \\
My first interaction with Siddhartha was during his 5th semester of undergraduate studies when he expressed interest in working with me in the Cryptography group. Since August 2022, I have started mentoring him and a PhD student on a research project on Quantum Cryptography. He has dedicated a considerable amount of time working on Quantum Cryptography, especially on the Simon algorithm, to find periodic functions which can be useful in finding keys or significant periods to solve Feistel, Even - Mansour and Misty ciphers. \\ \\
He has excellent Python and Sage programming experience, which comes in handy to apply the concepts learned and understand the works of other researchers. He is taking a 6-level Quantum Algorithms and Cryptography course, which helps him know cryptography concepts. He is taking a 5-level course on Quantum Computing and Information theory offered by the physics department. He is also taking a lab course to learn to program IBM quantum computers using the Qiskit library. \\\\
Likewise, he displayed a commendable work ethic and successfully handled his responsibilities. Although he had no experience in the field, he worked hard and could grasp details and pitch his work effectively with the team. He is always ready to work on new challenges, always aiming to enhance his scientific skills, and is focused on developing his fundamentals. \\ \\
Therefore, I recommend him for the Mitacs Globalink research internship program. Due to my interactions with him, I can assure you that he is an excellent candidate for the program who will work hard and dedicatedly on his projects. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
